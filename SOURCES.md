## Notes on Sources

### Limitations & Gaps

**Colonial Bias:** Many early written sources filter jumbie beliefs through colonial prejudices, describing them as "superstitions" or "negro beliefs." These sources must be read critically.

**Oral Tradition:** Much jumbie knowledge remains in oral tradition, never written down. Extensive fieldwork required for comprehensive documentation.

**Regional Variation:** Each Caribbean island and even individual villages have variations in jumbie types and beliefs. No single source captures all diversity.

**Language Barriers:** Some sources in French Creole, Dutch Creole, or other languages not widely accessible. Translation needed.

### Ongoing Research Needs

- Comprehensive digital database of jumbie types across all Caribbean territories
- Oral history projects with elderly tradition-bearers before knowledge is lost
- Linguistic analysis of jumbie terminology across Creole languages
- Comparative analysis of African source cultures and Caribbean developments
- Study of diaspora belief transmission and adaptation
- Children's folklore and jumbie socialization practices
- Contemporary urban jumbie beliefs and adaptations

### Respectful Engagement with Sources

When using these sources, remember:
- Center Caribbean voices and scholars
- Acknowledge African diaspora heritage and historical trauma
- Recognize jumbie beliefs as living spiritual traditions, not museum pieces
- Obtain informed consent for fieldwork
- Return knowledge to communities
- Respect sacred or dangerous knowledge that shouldn't be shared

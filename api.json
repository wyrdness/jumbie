      "summary": "An umbrella term for ghosts, spirits, and supernatural entities in Caribbean folklore, particularly in Trinidad and the Lesser Antilles. Jumbies encompass a wide range of beings from malevolent spirits to ancestral ghosts, nature spirits, and shapeshifters, deeply rooted in African diaspora beliefs.",
      "full": "Jumbie is the generic Caribbean term for ghosts, spirits, demons, and supernatural entities that exist in the liminal space between the living and dead. Unlike the narrow Western concept of 'ghost,' jumbie encompasses a vast spiritual taxonomy: malevolent spirits of the dead, ancestral presences, nature spirits inhabiting trees and water, protective house spirits, vengeful murdered souls, and shapeshifting entities. The term originates from West African spiritual traditions brought by enslaved peoples, merging with indigenous Carib and Arawak beliefs and European supernatural folklore. Jumbies can be helpful or harmful, guardian or trickster, bound to specific locations or wandering freely. They include specific types like Douen (children's spirits with backwards feet), Lagahoo (shapeshifting werewolf-demon), Mama D'Leau (water spirit), La Diablesse (beautiful devil woman), and many others. Protection against jumbies involves salt, prayers, turned clothing, specific herbs, and respect for the dead. The jumbie tradition represents a sophisticated cosmology of the spirit world that continues to shape Caribbean culture, identity, and community memory."

Jumbies are neither purely evil nor good; they represent the complexity of the spirit world. Respecting the dead, maintaining proper rituals, and living righteously provides protection. The living and dead remain connected through the jumbie realm."

Jumbies represented agency in contexts of extreme disempowerment.",
      "memory_and_trauma": "Many jumbies embody historical trauma—spirits of murdered enslaved people, those who died without proper burial, children stolen from families. Plantation sites remain heavily haunted, carrying memory of violence. Jumbie stories preserve historical experiences that official colonial records erased or minimized."

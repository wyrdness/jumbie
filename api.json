      "full": "Unlike the narrow Western concept of \\\"ghost,\\\" jumbie represents a complex spiritual cosmology rooted in **West and Central African traditions** that recognizes multiple categories of supernatural entities: malevolent spirits of the dead, ancestral presences, nature spirits dwelling in trees and waters, protective house spirits, vengeful murdered souls, trickster entities, shapeshifters, and far more. Jumbie traditions traveled to the Caribbean through the transatlantic slave trade, carried by enslaved peoples from diverse African ethnic groups. In the Caribbean, these beliefs merged with **indigenous Taíno and Kalinago spirit concepts** and **European ghost folklore**, creating a distinctly Caribbean yet recognizably African spiritual system that has survived centuries of cultural suppression. Jumbies can be: The jumbie tradition is not merely \\\"superstition\\\" but a sophisticated understanding of death, the afterlife, spiritual agency, and the continuing presence of the ancestors. It represents cultural memory, particularly of the African diaspora experience, and continues to shape Caribbean identity, community practices, and artistic expression."
